The proxy data in the 20th century seems to have some serious bugs. I need to have a look in all proxy timeseries once again. Probably some locations just have wrong values.

To-do:
	- quick look through all proxy timeseries
	- discard mixed mineralogy locations
	- discard proxies which have a large height difference, I guess these locations cause some trouble
